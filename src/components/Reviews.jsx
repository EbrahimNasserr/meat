            My favorite burger place in Amman. Small restaurant but it is very
            busy. There is a cue during the evening. If you want to eat when
            there is less people, go during lunch.Their beef burger is really
            really good. Chicken is also good, but beef is better. The chicken
            tenders are also good

            When you come from a European country where you hardly find a good
            halal burger and then you visit meat and cheese you will go wild ðŸ˜….
            It's really the best of the best , go for lady Gaga (The sandwich
            ðŸ˜‰), it will put you directly in the mood and give you all the joy
            you expect from a perfect sandwich. The staff is really friendly and
            always smiling.

            100000/10 burger. It's a must-visit spot that delivers on taste,
            presentation, and overall experience! I got the bob marley burger it
            was beyond delightful!!
