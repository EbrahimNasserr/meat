                <p className=" text-2xl text-slate-50 uppercase my-5">
                  In 2022, the brothers&apos; vision expanded beyond their
                  original location. With a solid franchise system in place,
                  they opened their first franchise in 2023. This marked the
                  beginning of Meat & Cheezz&apos;s growth, not just as a local
                  favorite but as a brand poised for broader horizons. What
                  started as a risky gamble had transformed into a flourishing
                  business model, and now, Meat & Cheezz is ready to spread its
                  cheesy goodness across Jordan and beyond.
                </p>
                <p className="text-2xl uppercase text-slate-50">
                  This is more than a story of burgers; it&apos;s a tale of
                  vision, determination, and the power of believing in something
                  when no one else does. Meat & Cheezz isn&apos;t just a
                  restaurantâ€”it&apos;s a local legend in the making.
